If there are any urgent issues relating to the safety of the child, the Child Representative must write to court immediately requesting for urgent audience.

(3) Any party (referred to in this paragraph as “the requestor”) who has been granted an order referred to in sub-paragraph (2) and who intends to seek assistance from the ICA to prevent the child from being taken out of Singapore must do the following:

(3A) If the order referred to in sub-paragraph (3)(a) ceases to have effect, or is varied or discharged pursuant to a further Court order (referred to in this paragraph as a “further order”) such that the travel restrictions no longer apply, the requestor shall notify the ICA of the same, provide a copy of the extracted further order in that notification, and copy that notification to the other party or parties to the proceedings in which that further order was obtained. Where the effect of the further order is to remove travel restrictions, ICA will only act on the basis of an extracted further order.

(3B) If the order referred to in sub-paragraph (3)(a) is varied pursuant to a further order such that further travel restrictions apply, the requestor shall immediately notify the ICA of the same, provide a copy of the further order in that notification (in which event the requirements set out at sub-paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) would apply, with the necessary modifications in relation to the further order as they apply in relation to the order referred to in sub-paragraph (3)(a)), and copy the other party or parties to the proceedings in which that further order was obtained.

(3C)     Where written consent is required to bring the child out of Singapore, such consent shall be given in Form 190B of Appendix A of these Practice Directions, and the ICA shall be notified of such consent.

(3D)    All notifications to the ICA referred to in this paragraph must be given at least 1 working day before they are intended to have effect.

(4) The notifications to the ICA referred to in sub-paragraphs (3)(a), (3A), (3B) and (3C), and the copies of the extracted orders or further orders referred to in sub-paragraphs (3)(b), (3A) and (3B), must be sent to the ICA via email (which should not exceed 5MB in size) to the email address set out below (and copied to the other party (being a party to the proceedings in relation to which the notification was sent to the ICA or the order was obtained) or the party’s solicitors via email or ordinary mail, whichever is applicable).

(5) The ICA will not provide assistance to stop the child from being taken out of Singapore or otherwise take any action under this paragraph if any party fails to comply with the requirements in this paragraph.

(6) If the ICA’s assistance to enforce the order referred to in sub-paragraph (3)(a) or a further order referred to in sub-paragraph (3B) is no longer required, the requestor shall notify the ICA of the same with brief reasons, and send a copy of the notification and brief reasons to every other party to the proceedings in which that order or further order was obtained.
